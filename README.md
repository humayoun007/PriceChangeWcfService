# PriceChangeWcfService
This is a sample WCF service which has been created as a callback service using wsDualHttpBinding for using in any console, windows form or wpf as a client.

This service is a self host wcf service, this means there is no need a svc file for this service to deploy in IIS. This is auto hosted by itself, it's a console application but you can create a wcf service library project and create a console project which will refer that library project dll that way you can also make a self hosting wcf service project.
